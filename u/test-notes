The current test failures are caused because of a confusion in the
representation of component names.  Originally, names were simply
strings. and are frequently used throughout the program as hask keys,
for example in the $type->{O} hash mapping subfeature names to
subfeature types.  But with the introduction of array types, names got
a more complex representation, as an array of strings and arrays.

Both representations are used in different places.  Using the complex
representation as a hash key doesn't work properly.  The first step is
to use the complex representation throughout; the second step is to
redo all the places that use names as hash keys to preserve the complex
implementation instead of stringizing it.
