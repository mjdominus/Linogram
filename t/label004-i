# This file actually contains a bug. 
# The param spec   text="foo"  is incorrect
# because text is not a string, but  a label, whcih is extended 
# from point.  text=(3,5) would make sense, and equate
# text.x=3 and text.x=5, but text="foo" is no good.
# It *should* raise a type error.
# It should have been written   text.label="foo" .
