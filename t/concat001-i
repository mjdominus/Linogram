This doesn't work, and I think rightly so. Although

        c = a+b

looks plausible, it opens a potentially big can of worms, because what
if c and b are known but a isn't?  When a, b, and c are numbers, we
interpret this to mean a (numeric) equation where

        c - (a+b) = 0

but for strings, what does "-" mean?  The existing system complains
that it can't scale a string by -1, which I think is just the right
thing to do.
