# From _Games for the Superintelligent_, Jim Fixx, 1972:
#
#        A rope over the top of a fence has the same length on each
#        side and weighs one-third of a pound per foot. On one end of
#        the rope hangs a monkey holding a banana, and on the other end
#        a weight equal to the weight of the monkey. The banana weighs
#        2 ounces per inch. The length of the rope in feet is the same
#        as the age of the monkey, and the weight of the monkey in
#        ounces is as much as the age of the monkey's mother. The
#        combined ages of the monkey and its mother is 30
#        years. One-half the weight of the monkey plus the weight of
#        the banana is one-fourth the sum of the weights of the rope
#        and the weight. The monkey's mother is one-half as old as the
#        monkey will be when it is three times as old as its mother was
#        when she was one-half as old as the monkey will be when it is
#        as old as its mother will be when she is four times as old as
#        the monkey was when it was twice as old as its mother was when
#        she was one-third as old as the monkey was when it was as old
#        as its mother was when she was three times as old as the
#        monkey was when it was one-fourth as old as its is now. How
#        long is the banana?
